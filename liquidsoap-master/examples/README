Here are some examples of how to run liquidsoap. Note that most examples
require you to edit at least the filename of the default file, otherwise
they'll fail to startup with an "infallible source" error.

* radio.liq         an example of radio program, easy to adapt and test
* geek.liq          a more complex full-featured example
* fallible.liq      example of fallible scheduler
* transitions.liq   an example of custom transitions
