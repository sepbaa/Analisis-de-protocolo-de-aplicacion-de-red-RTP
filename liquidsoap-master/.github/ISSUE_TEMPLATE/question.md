**Thanks for using liquidsoap**

Please, feel free to ask your question here. However, we do prefer questions to be asked either on our slack channel: http://slack.liquidsoap.info/ or via the mailing list at savonet-users@lists.sourceforge.net (register here: https://sourceforge.net/p/savonet/mailman/savonet-users/). This way, we can get the whole community to participate and benefit from them.

If you need more information about how to use liquidsoap, the documentation is at https://liquidsoap.info/doc.html. Please note that we're currently working on refreshing it so stay tunes and come back to check it out soon!
