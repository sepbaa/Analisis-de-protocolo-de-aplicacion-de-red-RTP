Liquidsoap
==========

Our flagship is Liquidsoap, a swiss-army knife for multimedia streaming, notably
used for netradios and webtvs. It has tons of features, it's free and it's
open-source!

Liquidsoap is a powerful and flexible language for describing your streams. It
offers a rich collection of operators that you can combine to create and
transform streams. Liquidsoap is very light and easy to use, in the Unix
tradition of simple strong components working together.
