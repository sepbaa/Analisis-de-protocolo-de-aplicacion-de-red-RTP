(** The request is actually the file abstraction in liquidsoap, used
  * whenever possible. *)

type metadata = (string, string) Hashtbl.t

(** An indicator is a resource location (URI),
  * when meaningful, it can be declared as temporary if liquidsoap
  * should destroy it after usage (this means deleting a local file). *)
type indicator

val indicator : ?metadata:metadata -> ?temporary:bool -> string -> indicator

(** Type of requests,
  * which are devices for obtaining a local file from an URI. *)
type t

(** Create a request. *)
val create :
  ?metadata:(string * string) list ->
  ?persistent:bool ->
  ?indicators:indicator list ->
  string ->
  t

(** Return the type of a media request, None for raw requests. *)
val ctype : t -> Frame.content_type option

(** Return the request's initial uri. *)
val initial_uri : t -> string

(** Destroying of a requests causes its file to be deleted if it's a temporary
  * one, for example a downloaded file. If the metadata ["persistent"] is
  * set to ["true"], destroying doesn't happen, unless [force] is set too.
  * Persistent sources are useful for static URIs (see below for the definition
  * of staticity,
  * and in [src/sources/one_file.ml] for an example of use). *)

(** {1 General management} *)

(** Called at exit, for cleaning temporary files

(** {1 Resolving}
  *
  * Resolving consists in many steps. Every step consist in rewriting the
  * first URI into other URIs. The process ends when the first URI
  * is a local filename. For example, the initial URI can be a database query,
  * which is then turned into a list of remote locations, which are then
  * tentatively downloaded...
  * At each step [protocol.resolve first_uri timeout] is called,
  * and the function is expected to push the new URIs in the request. *)

type protocol = { resolve : resolver; static : bool }

(** A static request [r] is such that every resolving leads to the same file.
  * Sometimes, it allows removing useless destroy/create/resolve. *)
val is_static : string -> bool

(** Resolving can fail because an URI is invalid, or doesn't refer to a valid
  * audio file, or simply because there was no enough time left. *)
type resolve_flag = Resolved | Failed | Timeout

(** Read the metadata for the toplevel indicator of the request. This is usually
    performed automatically by [resolve] so that you do not have to use this,
    excepting when the [ctype] is [None]. *)
val read_metadata : t -> unit

(** [resolve ?ctype request timeout] tries to resolve the request within
    [timeout] seconds. It finds a decoder for the request which produces content
    type [ctype], unless this is set to [None]. If resolving succeeds, [is_ready
    request] is true and you can get a filename. *)
val resolve : ctype:Frame.content_type option -> t -> float -> resolve_flag

(** [is_ready r] if there's an available local filename. It can be true even if
  * the resolving hasn't been run, if the initial URI was already a local
  * filename. *)
val is_ready : t -> bool

(** Return a valid local filename if there is one, which means that the request
  * is ready. *)
val get_filename : t -> string option

(** {1 URI manipulation} For protocol plugins. *)

(** Removes the top URI, possibly destroys the associated file. *)
val pop_indicator : t -> unit

(** Return the top URI, without removing it. *)
val peek_indicator : t -> string

(** In most of the case you don't peek or pop any URI, you just push the
  * new URIs you computed from [first_uri]. *)

(** [duration filename] computes the duration of audio data contained in

  * Metadata filling isn't included in Decoder because we want it to
  * occur immediately after request resolution. *)
