(* The [cue_cut] class is able to skip over the beginning and end
 * of a track according to cue points.
 * This involves quite a bit of trickery involving clocks, #seek as well
 * as reverting frame contents. Even more trickery would be needed to
 * implement a [cue_split] operator that splits tracks according to
 * cue points: in particular, the frame manipulation would get nasty,
 * involving storing chunks that have been fetched too early, replaying
 * them later, glued with new content. *)

(* We use ticks for precision, but store them as Int64 to allow
 * long durations. This should eventually be generalized to all of
 * liquidsoap, removing limitations such as the duration passed to
 * #seek or returned by #remaining.
 * We introduce a few notations to make this comfortable. *)
