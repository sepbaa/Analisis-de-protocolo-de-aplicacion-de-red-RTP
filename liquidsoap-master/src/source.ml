(** In this module we define the central streaming concepts: sources, active
  * sources and clocks.
  *
  * Sources can produce a stream, if something pulls it.
  * Sources can pull streams from other sources (such non-elementary sources
  * are called operators).
  * But who starts pulling?
  *
  * Some sources have a noticeable effect, for example outputs.
  * Some are indirectly needed by outputs.
  * Some are useless, they have no direct or indirect observable effect.
  * We only want to pull data from sources that have an effect,
  * thereby "animating them". Those sources are called active.
  *
  * Clocks are in charge of animating active sources.
  * Each clock "owns" a number of active sources, and indirectly some
  * sources owned by those active sources,
  * and controls access to their streams. *)

(** Fallibility type MUST be defined BEFORE clocks.
  * Otherwise the module cannot be well-typed since the list of all
  * clock variables refers to active sources and hence to #stype : source_t.
  * Don't mess with this, type errors will give you a hard time!
  * (By the way, there's no problem of scope escaping for class type
  *  since those are structural, not nominal like a variant type.) *)
type source_t = Fallible | Infallible

(** {1 Proto clocks} 
  *
  * Roughly describe what a clock is, and build a notion of clock variable
  * on top of that. More concrete clock stuff is done the [Clock] module.
  *
  * Clocks play two roles:
  *  (1) making sure that one source belongs to only one time flow,
  *  (2) giving a handle on how to run a time flow.
  *
  * Most clocks are passive, i.e. they don't run anything
  * directly, but may only tick when something happens to a source.
  * The clock is the default, active clock:
  * when started, it launches a thread which keeps ticking regularly.
  *
  * A clock needs to know all the active sources under its control,
  * so it can execute them. This might seem surprising in some cases:
  *   cross(s)       <-- create a clock, assigns it to s
  *   output.file(s) <-- also assigns it to the output
  * In effect, we make it equivalent to
  *   cross(output.file(s))
  * Anyway, it'd be very strange that an output isn't animated at all.
  *
  * Clock variables can represent an unknown clock, with attached outputs.
  * A source gets assigned a clock variable, which might leave it
  * a chance to choose that clock (by attempting to unify it).
  *
  * The idea is that when an output is created it assigns a clock to itself
  * according to its sources' clocks. Eventually, all remaining unknown clocks
  * are forced to clock. *)

(** {1 Clock variables}
  * Used to infer what clock a source belongs to.
  * Each variable comes with
  *   - a list of active sources belonging to the clock, unused during
  *     inference/unification, but animated by the clock when running
  *   - a list of sub-clocks, used during unification's occurs-check
  *     to avoid cycles which would result in unsound behavior
  *     e.g. add([s,cross(f,s)]).
  * Clock constants are objects of type [proto_clock], but need to also
  * maintain the information attached to variables.
  *
  * The unification algorithm can be described as follows, ignoring
  * the active source maintenance.
  * X[Y1,Y2,..,Yn] denotes a variable or constant clock with the set Gamma
  *    of subclocks,
  *    from a first-order unification perspective it should be thought of
  *    as a term X(Y1,Y2,..,Yn,...) where the second ... denotes a
  *    row variable: we don't know if there are more parameters there
  *    (more subclocks)
  * We write X[Gamma] with Gamma list of clocks, and X[..Y..] when
  * Y belongs to the subclocks of X, or the subclocks of the subclocks,
  * etc.
  * Unification rules are:
  *   X[..Y..] = Y[..]    ---> ERROR (occurs-check)
  *   c1[...]  = c2[...]  ---> ERROR (rigid-rigid)
  *   X[Gamma] = Y[Delta] ---> X,Y:=Z[Gamma,Delta]
  *      Here Gamma,Delta denotes an union. It is possible that two
  *      distinct variables might become unified, in which case we'll
  *      end up with two occurrences of the same subclock.
