     * We always have read<=write.
     * We can always write.
     * We can read when read<write.

     * Now, let's force that write-read<=N.
     * We can write when read-write<N.
     * We can read when read<write.
     *
     * Now, this restriction allows us to work with a ringbuffer of N cells,
     * and read (resp. write) in cell number read (resp. write) modulo N.
     * If we only keep read and write modulo N, we cannot distinguish
     *  - read=write (i.e., the reader has to wait for the writer)
     *  - read+N=write (i.e., the writer has to wait for the reader)
     * But it is enough to maintain read and write modulo 2N.
     * Indeed, if read<=write and write-read<=N, then:
     *  - read = write iff read mod 2N = write mod 2N
     *  - write-read=N iff (read mod 2N <> read mod 2N and
