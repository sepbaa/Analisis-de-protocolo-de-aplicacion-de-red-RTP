  Give names to threads, and forbid them to raise an exception;
  if that happens, the thread dies anyway but it is logged and [main]
  will notice it.
  The main process is expected to run [main] after having launched
  the needed threads: that function will sleep until a thread
  raises an exception. *)

  *
  * The thread function receives a [should_stop,has_stop] pair on startup.
  * It should regularly poll the [should_stop] and stop when asked to.
  * Before stopping it should call [has_stopped].
  *
  * The function returns a [kill,wait] pair. The first function should be
  * called to request that the thread stops, and the second to wait
  * that it has effectively stopped. *)
