(** {1 Video frame manipulation}
  *
  * This is a simplified video-only version of Frame. Some parts of Frame,
  * such as the metadata API, is unavailable. This is because it must
  * be used with care.
  *
  * Even video-only operators must comply to the general requirements
  * of sources in liquidsoap. In particular they should be able to fill
  * a frame starting at any position. That position might not be
  * a video position -- in that case, the first video sample to work on,
  * if there is one, will be a little farther in the frame. When looking
  * for metadata (usually attached at the beginning of a track) a
  * video position cannot be used, for the same reason: the track might
  * not start on a video sample position. *)

(** Is it partially filled ? *)
val is_partial : t -> bool

(** Number of video frames. *)

(** [get_content source frame] has [source] fill [frame],
  * and returns the produced chunk of video content.
  * It is possible that a successful filling produced audio samples
  * but no video sample. *)

(** Get yuv420p video content. Raises [Frame_content.Invalid] if video
  * content is not yuv420p and [Not_found] if frame has no video content. *)
